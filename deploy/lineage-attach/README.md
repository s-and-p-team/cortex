# Lineage — per-request data lineage from the AuthBridge sidecar

Every HTTP exchange a workload takes part in crosses its pod's network
boundary. A sidecar at that boundary sees all of it — who called whom, over
which protocol, with what outcome, and — if you switch it on — what was said.
Attach the AuthBridge sidecar to a Deployment that is **already running**,
switch on the `lineage-telemetry` plugin, and each exchange becomes **two
OTLP spans**, request and response, sent to any OTLP consumer. The application
is not asked to do anything, and nothing about what it does enters into it.

One thing the boundary cannot see is which inbound request caused which
outbound call. Only code running inside the request can carry that, and it
does so by forwarding two headers, `traceparent` and `tracestate`. So the app image gets one
inert layer — stock OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation with every exporter
off — that wakes on a single environment variable and forwards the header.
The app's source, command and manifests stay as its owner wrote them.

That is the whole attachment: a ConfigMap and a strategic-merge patch on the
cluster side, an image reference and one variable on the app side. It is
additive, it is reversible with one printed reverse patch, and it is the same
for every workload in the fleet — an agent, a tool, a relay, a service nobody
remembers writing.

The sidecar image defaults to the pinned release
`ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/authbridge-envoy:v0.8.1`, a release that carries
`lineage-telemetry` (with `proxy-init:v0.8.1` beside it). Pinned rather than
`:latest` on purpose: the patch pulls `IfNotPresent`, so a node that cached a
floating tag before the plugin shipped keeps serving that binary, and the
sidecar crashloops on the unknown plugin name (`plugins.Build` fails closed,
the startupProbe never passes, a rolling update stalls with the old pods still
serving). To run a build of this tree instead, [RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md) step 1
builds and loads it and `SIDECAR_IMAGE` points at it; `NO_EMIT=1` gives a
parsers-only sidecar that emits nothing, the A/B baseline.

**Start here:** [RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md) — six steps, expected output, back
out. **Why it works and where it stops:** [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). **See it
run:** the [lineage demo](../../demos/lineage/README.md) on the Weather Agent pair.

## What you get

Per HTTP exchange, two spans. The request span is named
`{self_id} {protocol} {operation}`, the response span appends ` response`; the
pair is joined by `lineage.exchange.id` (the request span's own id):

| attribute | what it records |
|---|---|
| `lineage.exchange.id` · `lineage.role` | pairs the two spans of one exchange; `request` / `response` |
| `lineage.direction` · `lineage.self.id` · `lineage.peer.host` | `inbound` / `outbound`; this workload's stable id; the other end |
| `lineage.protocol` | `a2a` / `mcp` / `inference` / `http` |
| `lineage.outcome`, `lineage.denied_by` | how the exchange ended |
| `lineage.principal.sub`, `lineage.principal.client` | the caller's identity when a validated token carried one — with `AUTH_ISSUER` set, which puts `jwt-validation` ahead of the plugin ("The user", below); absent otherwise |
| `lineage.parent.source` | `tracestate` — parented on the previous sidecar's stamp; `wire` — on a `traceparent` that arrived without a stamp; `none` — nothing valid arrived, so this hop roots a trace and a `traceparent` is minted for the next |
| `input.value` / `output.value` | with `capture_io: true`: the parsed A2A message, MCP arguments or LLM prompt, cut at `max_payload_bytes` (4096 unless `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` says otherwise) with a visible marker |

The attributes are the plugin's: [`plugin-catalog.md`](../../docs/plugin-catalog.md#lineage-telemetry)
lists its knobs, [`lineage-wire-contract.md`](../../docs/lineage-wire-contract.md) the wire format.

A well-propagated trace has exactly one unstamped hop, at the entry: `wire`
when the caller sent a `traceparent`, `none` when it sent nothing. Every other
unstamped hop marks a pod that did not carry the context through — `none` when
its app sent no `traceparent` at all, `wire` when it forwarded one without the
stamp — and the subtree beneath it is visibly its own trace rather than
silently misattributed. The spans say
what happened on the wire; whatever consumes them decides what it means.

---

## How to attach

The target is a Deployment that already exists. `attach-lineage.sh` generates
exactly two things — the per-app plugin ConfigMap (`EMIT=cm`) and a
strategic-merge patch with the sidecar pieces (`EMIT=patch`, the default) —
and there are two ways to consume them.

### Adopt a live Deployment

```sh
DEPLOY=<deployment> [APP_CONTAINER=<container> APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/<app>-otel:latest] ./sidecar-patch.sh
```

`sidecar-patch.sh` checks the preconditions (the Deployment exists, the
platform-rendered `envoy-config` ConfigMap is in the namespace, no container
already named `envoy-proxy`/`proxy-init`, no port collision, no volume
already named `envoy-config`/`authbridge-runtime` — volumes merge by name
too, so an existing one would have its source silently repointed — and
`APP_CONTAINER` names a real container), applies the ConfigMap,
patches the Deployment, and waits for the rollout. The patch only *adds* —
lists merge by name, so everything the owner wrote stays as written — except
the app container's `image`, which it replaces when `APP_IMAGE` is given (the
back-out restores the original). To back
out, run the reverse-patch line the script printed — a strategic merge that
`$patch: delete`s exactly what the attach added and restores the app image it
replaced, leaving every later change of the owner's in place — then delete
`authbridge-lineage-config-<name>`. (A `rollout undo` is not a back-out: it
restores a whole earlier pod template, silently taking with it anything the
owner changed since the attach.) The line is reconstructible without
scrollback: `EMIT=undo` with the attach's `NAME`/`NAMESPACE`/`APP_CONTAINER`
plus `RESTORE_IMAGE=<pre-attach ref>` regenerates the patch — not `APP_IMAGE`,
which is the ref to *install* and is refused in undo mode (RECIPE step 5).

Two limits. **The target must not already carry an AuthBridge sidecar** — a
platform-enrolled workload (an `AgentRuntime` CR) has an injected one, also
named `envoy-proxy`, so the script refuses rather than merge into it; see the
namespace route below. **A patch is not durable** — the owner still owns the
Deployment, and a platform-side rewrite (operator reconcile, chart upgrade, UI
redeploy) silently drops the sidecar. Re-run after such a change, or keep the
attachment in the manifests.

### Bring your own manifests

If you own the app's manifests, make lineage part of them instead — the
attachment then survives every re-deploy:

```sh
NAME=my-agent NAMESPACE=my-ns EMIT=cm    ./attach-lineage.sh > lineage-cm.yaml
NAME=my-agent NAMESPACE=my-ns EMIT=patch APP_CONTAINER=agent APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/my-agent-otel:latest \
  ./attach-lineage.sh > lineage-patch.yaml
```

`NAMESPACE` defaults to `team1` and is written into the generated ConfigMap —
set it to your app's namespace. Omit it and the ConfigMap is stamped
`namespace: team1` while kustomize still places the Deployment in its own
namespace: the patched pod then mounts a ConfigMap that is not there and hangs
in `ContainerCreating`.

```yaml
# kustomization.yaml
resources: [deployment.yaml, service.yaml, lineage-cm.yaml]   # yours untouched, plus the generated cm
patches:
  - path: lineage-patch.yaml
    target: { kind: Deployment, name: my-agent }
```

### The propagation half

Both routes attach **capture**. For *attribution* — outbound hops landing in
the trace of the inbound that caused them — the app must forward
`traceparent`: its own instrumentation, or the shim:

```sh
./build-otel-shim.sh <your-app>:latest    # -> <your-app>-otel:latest, attested, kind-loaded
```

then hand the patch the container to switch on: `APP_CONTAINER=<name>` adds
`LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1` to that container's env (merged by name — nothing else
in the container changes) and `APP_IMAGE=…-otel:latest` points it at the baked
image. Without `APP_CONTAINER` the app container is not touched at all. The
sidecar is a native initContainer, not a regular one, so the app stays the
pod's sole regular container — `kubectl logs`/`exec` without `-c` keep hitting
it, unchanged.

The `-otel` image must be resolvable the way the base is: the patch swaps
`image` and leaves `imagePullPolicy` alone, so a kind-loaded image needs
`IfNotPresent` and a registry-pulled base needs the `-otel` tag pushed beside
it. A Deployment whose env you cannot touch at all has one lever left, the
image reference: `SELF_ACTIVATE=1 ./build-otel-shim.sh <your-app>:latest` bakes
the switch in (the image argument is required).

### Enrolled workloads: the namespace-ConfigMap route

When the platform injects its own AuthBridge sidecar (an `AgentRuntime` CR),
lineage is enabled for the whole namespace by adding the three parsers +
`lineage-telemetry` to both directions of the operator-rendered
`authbridge-runtime-config` ConfigMap. Leave `self_id` unset — each pod
resolves its identity from the operator-mounted credential. For the namespace
fact (required; it is what keeps two same-named pods in two namespaces two
entities at the consumer, wire contract §7) do **not** write a literal
`namespace: team1` into that ConfigMap: the platform chart renders it from one
template for every agent namespace and the operator copies the release
namespace's ConfigMap into namespaces that lack one, so a literal would be
confidently wrong in every namespace but one. Use the file source instead,
which is correct in every copy:

```yaml
- name: lineage-telemetry
  config:
    otel_endpoint: "otel-collector.rossoctl-system.svc.cluster.local:4317"
    namespace_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace
```

That file is projected by the kubelet from the pod's own metadata into every
container that mounts the service-account volume; if the injected sidecar
does not mount it, the plugin refuses to start (loudly, naming the path)
rather than guess. The propagation half is unchanged, and a platform upgrade
re-renders the ConfigMap; re-apply after one. This route is described here,
not exercised: nothing in this kit generates that edit.

**Upgrading across the namespace key.** A sidecar built before the key
rejects any config that carries it (unknown keys are a boot error), and one
built with it refuses any config that lacks it — so the image and the
ConfigMap flip together, per pod, never one before the other. On the kit
route that is one command: re-run `sidecar-patch.sh` with a `SIDECAR_IMAGE`
that carries the key; it rewrites the ConfigMap and patches the Deployment,
and the image change rolls the pod. A re-run with an unchanged image rolls no
pod, and the running sidecar only hot-reloads the ConfigMap — the script says
so and names the log line to check.

---

## What it costs, per workload

Deploying the app is your work and stays your work. Attaching lineage adds
two commands and no YAML:

| step | command | per | done for you |
|---|---|---|---|
| bake | `./build-otel-shim.sh <image>` | image | interpreter and uid detection, the interlock, the attestation, the kind load |
| attach | `DEPLOY=<name> APP_CONTAINER=<c> APP_IMAGE=…-otel:latest ./sidecar-patch.sh` | Deployment | the ConfigMap, the patch, six preconditions, the rollout wait |

Capture only is one command, the attach without `APP_CONTAINER`. A fleet is
two loops (RECIPE "A fleet"). Then read the *shape* of one trace: one root per
turn, unstamped only at the entry.

---

## Prerequisites and configuration

On the host running the scripts:

- **`kubectl`** (the attach path) and **`kind`** (the bake's image load) on
  `PATH`; a container engine, **podman** or **docker** (`CONTAINER_TOOL`
  selects, nothing else is supported); **`python3`** for the verify step.
- **Network egress at bake time** to `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` and PyPI — the
  shim build pulls `uv` and the OpenTelemetry packages. `NO_KIND_LOAD=1` skips
  only the cluster load, not the build, so the bake is not offline-capable;
  the image *probes* run `--network=none`, the build does not.
- **RBAC** in the target namespace: get/patch/watch `deployments` (the rollout
  wait watches) and get/create/patch/delete `configmaps` (a re-attach `apply`s —
  i.e. patches — over an existing ConfigMap); the verify step also needs `create pods` in
  the namespace and `get deployments` + `get pods/log` in `rossoctl-system`.

In the cluster:

- A cluster with the platform installed and the platform-rendered
  **`envoy-config` ConfigMap** in the target namespace (the sidecar mounts it).
- **Kubernetes ≥ 1.29** — the sidecar is attached as a *native sidecar* (an
  `initContainers` entry with `restartPolicy: Always`), on by default since 1.29
  (GA in 1.33). On an older cluster the apiserver rejects the native-sidecar
  fields (`startupProbe: Forbidden: may not be set for init containers without
  restartPolicy=Always`) — loud, on **both** routes: the adopt path at
  `sidecar-patch.sh`'s server-side dry-run, before any write (with a needs-1.29
  hint); the manifests route at your own `kubectl apply` of the Deployment —
  the ConfigMap from that same apply does persist, inert on its own (no pod
  references it), so delete it if you back off.
- Sidecar images resolvable from the cluster: `SIDECAR_IMAGE` /
  `PROXY_INIT_IMAGE`, defaulting to the pinned release
  `ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/{authbridge-envoy,proxy-init}:v0.8.1`, which
  carries the plugin (why pinned: the top of this page).
- An **OTLP/gRPC endpoint**, `OTEL_ENDPOINT`, default
  `otel-collector.rossoctl-system.svc.cluster.local:4317`. Nothing downstream
  is assumed; DESIGN "Where you see the spans" covers the platform collector.
- **Know what leaves the pod.** Content capture is off by default, as in the
  plugin. `CAPTURE_IO=true` makes the spans carry parsed content: LLM prompts,
  MCP arguments, A2A messages, cut at 4,096 bytes (`MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`;
  `-1` keeps them whole). That content is
  PII-bearing. It travels to `OTEL_ENDPOINT` as plain gRPC unless the endpoint
  starts with `https://`, and on the stock platform the collector prints every
  attribute into its own pod log.

The generated ConfigMap's plugin entry:

```yaml
- name: lineage-telemetry
  config:
    otel_endpoint: "otel-collector.rossoctl-system.svc.cluster.local:4317"   # host:port; https:// prefix turns on TLS
    capture_io: false     # the plugin's default; CAPTURE_IO=true attaches the parsed content — PII lives in it
    self_id: "<deploy>"   # ALWAYS set (SELF_ID, default: the Deployment name) — see below
    namespace: "<ns>"     # ALWAYS set (NAMESPACE): the plugin refuses to start without it
    # max_payload_bytes: 4096 — the plugin's default cap on a captured value (MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES)
```

`namespace` is the pod's Kubernetes namespace and rides on every span as
`lineage.self.namespace`; the consumer keys an entity on the (namespace,
`self_id`) pair, so the same Deployment name in two namespaces stays two
entities. `self_id` is always emitted: the plugin's `self_id_file` fallback (the
operator-mounted credential, which can race its own Secret and fail the
sidecar's boot) is deliberately never used on a ConfigMap this kit generates.
The plugin's `bypass_paths` / `bypass_hosts` keep infrastructure noise out
(agent-card discovery, health probes, telemetry backends) at their **plugin
defaults** — they are not adjustable from this kit: setting either key
*replaces* the default list rather than extending it, and a hand-edit of the
generated ConfigMap only lasts until the next attach or back-out rewrites it.
`OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE` keeps
a port out of the iptables redirect: an app's own telemetry export port, or a
**plaintext non-HTTP store** it talks to (Postgres 5432, SMTP 1025, Redis 6379
— the outbound listener's HTTP codec would close them; DESIGN "What the
sidecar can and cannot see"). Never exclude LLM, tool, peer or S3 ports.
`NO_EMIT=1` keeps the sidecar as a pure proxy — a clean A/B baseline (with
`AUTH_ISSUER` set as well, a gate that emits nothing).

**The user.** Every fact above names workloads; none names the person who
asked. The plugin emits `lineage.principal.sub` and `lineage.principal.client`
on an inbound request span **only** when a gate plugin ahead of it in the chain
validated a JWT — it never infers an identity from an address. `AUTH_ISSUER`
puts that gate in: the generated inbound chain gains `jwt-validation` ahead of
the parsers, and the plugin entry is

```yaml
- name: jwt-validation
  config:
    issuer: "http://keycloak.localtest.me:8080/realms/rossoctl"     # AUTH_ISSUER — the token's iss, bit for bit
    audience: "http://keycloak.localtest.me:8080/realms/rossoctl"   # AUTH_AUDIENCE, default = the issuer (see below)
    # jwks_url: "http://keycloak-service.keycloak.svc:8080/realms/rossoctl/protocol/openid-connect/certs"  # AUTH_JWKS_URL
```

Three things follow, and the first is the one to decide on. (1) The gate
**denies**: an inbound request without a valid bearer token for that issuer and
audience is answered `401` by the sidecar and never reaches the app — so this
belongs on the workload users call directly (the entry agent), not on a tool an
agent calls, which receives no user token. And **the default audience is wide
open on purpose**: with `AUTH_AUDIENCE` unset the gate accepts any token the
realm minted for *any* client (the audience check is the confused-deputy
guard; the demo wants every realm user through). Past a demo, set
`AUTH_AUDIENCE` to the workload's own client id. (2) A denied request emits **no
lineage span**: the pipeline stops at the gate before the plugin runs (the wire
contract's "Scope of denied"), so lineage sees only the callers the gate let
through. (3) The value is the token's `sub` as the IdP minted it — on Keycloak
an opaque UUID, and only when the client's scopes include `basic` (Keycloak 25+
puts `sub` there; a realm imported without that scope mints tokens with no
`sub`, and the plugin, which guesses nothing, emits no principal). The
data-governance consumer turns the fact into a `user:<sub>` entity as the
trace's root caller; without it the caller is `client:(unknown)`.

The default audience is the issuer URL because the rossoctl realm's
`rossoctl-platform-audience` default client scope (in the platform's realm
import, `charts/rossoctl-deps/templates/keycloak-realm-init.yaml` in the
rossoctl repo) stamps it on every token the realm mints — a token minted by a
client without that scope is refused, and the issuer is matched bit for bit
(a trailing slash on `AUTH_ISSUER` that the token's `iss` lacks denies every
token with the generic `token validation failed`; `token.sh` prints a token's
`iss` and `aud` so the two can be compared). `AUTH_JWKS_URL` is
for the split horizon: the sidecar fetches signing keys from inside the
cluster, where the issuer's public host usually does not resolve (on kind,
`*.localtest.me` is the pod's own loopback). The [lineage demo](../../demos/lineage/README.md)
step 6 walks through it, step 7 does the same from the platform UI.

Script knobs: `NAME`/`DEPLOY`, `NAMESPACE` (default `team1`), `SELF_ID`, `OTEL_ENDPOINT`,
`CAPTURE_IO`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `APP_CONTAINER`, `APP_IMAGE`, `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE`,
`AUTH_ISSUER`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE`, `AUTH_JWKS_URL`, `SIDECAR_IMAGE`,
`PROXY_INIT_IMAGE`, `NO_EMIT`, `EMIT`; each script's header documents its own.

## Files

Two moments, nine files. The bake happens once per image, on a laptop; the
attach once per Deployment, against the cluster. The only thing that crosses
between them is an image reference.

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | cause |
|---|---|
| No spans at all | Wrong `OTEL_ENDPOINT`, or the sidecar image predates the plugin — read the `envoy-proxy` container's log. |
| `envoy-proxy` restarts with `unknown plugin "lineage-telemetry"` | A sidecar image built before the plugin, or without its build tag. With `SIDECAR_IMAGE` on a floating tag, the usual cause is the node's cache: the patch pulls `IfNotPresent`, so a `:latest` cached before v0.8.1 is what runs — `crictl images` on the node shows it; remove it or use the pinned default. A build from source needs `GO_BUILD_TAGS` (RECIPE step 1). |
| `envoy-proxy` restarts with `json: unknown field "namespace"` | A ConfigMap from this kit against a sidecar image built before the namespace key. Re-run `sidecar-patch.sh` with a `SIDECAR_IMAGE` that carries it ("Upgrading across the namespace key"). |
| `envoy-proxy` restarts with `namespace is required` or `is not a DNS label` | A sidecar that carries the key against a ConfigMap that lacks it or hand-carries a value that is not a namespace. Re-run `sidecar-patch.sh` (it renders `NAMESPACE`, already validated as a DNS label). |
| Spans arrive without `lineage.self.namespace` after an attach that printed "attached" | The Deployment patch was a no-op (same image, same knobs), so no pod rolled and the old sidecar refused the hot-reload. The script prints a NOTE with the log line to check; re-run with a matching `SIDECAR_IMAGE`. |
| Only inbound hops, never outbound | `proxy-init` did not install its iptables rules — its log. |
| Outbound hops fragment (`lineage.parent.source=none` on the pod's outbound hops) | `traceparent` not propagating: the app container lacks `LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1` (the patch sets it with `APP_CONTAINER`; an operator-owned Deployment needs `SELF_ACTIVATE=1`), or the call runs in a worker thread (the `threading` instrumentor is bundled), or the client library is outside the envelope. Only the entry hop dangling is expected. |
| The app cannot reach its database / mail server after the patch | A plaintext non-HTTP port went through the outbound HTTP codec — `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE` it. |
| A non-HTTP port the app *serves* stops answering after the patch | Inbound is redirected too, and there is no inbound exclusion knob; the app cannot be adopted as is (DESIGN "What the sidecar can and cannot see"). Run the printed back-out line. |
| Nothing captured when testing | `kubectl port-forward` reaches the app on loopback and bypasses the sidecar. Drive from inside the cluster. |
| `kind load` fails under podman | `container-runtime.sh` saves + loads an archive for podman v5; `CONTAINER_TOOL` forces a runtime, `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` the cluster. |
| Sidecar `ImagePullBackOff` | `SIDECAR_IMAGE` / `PROXY_INIT_IMAGE` unresolvable from the cluster. |
| App container `ErrImagePull` after the patch | `APP_IMAGE` unresolvable under the container's own `imagePullPolicy` ("The propagation half"). Run the printed back-out line. |
| Pod stuck `ContainerCreating`, `configmap "envoy-config" not found` | Not a platform-set-up namespace (`sidecar-patch.sh` checks; the manifests route cannot). |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already has a container named …" | The target carries an `envoy-proxy` container or a `proxy-init` init container — enrolled workload, another mesh, or an earlier attach. Namespace route for the first; the printed back-out line for the last. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already declares containerPort …" | An undeclared sidecar, or the app itself listens on 9090/15123/15124; the latter cannot be adopted. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already has a volume named …" | The target owns a volume named `envoy-config` or `authbridge-runtime`. Volumes merge by name, so the patch would silently repoint that volume's source under the owner's own mounts; the target cannot be adopted until the owner renames their volume. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "has no container named …" | `APP_CONTAINER` matches nothing; a strategic merge would otherwise *add* a stub container by that name. |
