# sidecar-patch.sh — attach the lineage sidecar to an EXISTING Deployment.
#
# The live applier. The Deployment is deployed and owned by someone else; this
# script only ADDS the lineage pieces through a strategic-merge patch (lists
# merge by name, so nothing the owner wrote changes; the app container is
# touched only when APP_CONTAINER opts it in). Every YAML byte comes from
# attach-lineage.sh: EMIT=cm (the plugin ConfigMap), EMIT=patch (the sidecar).
# This script checks, applies both, and waits for the rollout.
#
# Not durable: the owner keeps owning the object, and a platform rewrite (an
# operator reconcile, a UI redeploy) silently drops the patch — observed live
# when an operator reconciled a patched Deployment. Re-run after any
# platform-side change, or keep the attachment in your own manifests instead
# (README.md "Bring your own manifests"). To back out: the reverse-patch line
# this script prints before the rollout wait — a strategic merge that deletes, by name, exactly
# what the attach added and restores the app image it replaced, so it is right
# at ANY later time, whatever else rolled the Deployment since — then delete
# the CM. (A `rollout undo` is NOT the back-out: it restores a whole earlier
# pod template, silently taking the owner's later changes with it.)
#
# Refused: a target that already carries a container named `envoy-proxy` or an
# init container named `proxy-init` (the operator's sidecar, another mesh's
# init, a leftover of an earlier attach — the merge would silently take it
# over rather than sit beside it), one that declares 9090, 15123 or 15124
# (an undeclared sidecar, or the app itself on a port the sidecar binds), or
# one that already has a volume named `envoy-config` or `authbridge-runtime`
# (volumes merge by name too — the merge would repoint the volume's source
# while the owner's volumeMounts keep serving it).
#
# Propagation: an uninstrumented app also needs the shim — bake it with
# build-otel-shim.sh, then pass APP_CONTAINER (+ APP_IMAGE) so the patch
# flips LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1 on the app's own container. Without it this is
# capture only (README.md "The propagation half").
#
# Usage:
#   DEPLOY=echo-upstream ./sidecar-patch.sh
#   DEPLOY=my-agent APP_CONTAINER=agent \
#     APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/my-agent-otel:latest ./sidecar-patch.sh
#
# Env — read here:
#   DEPLOY         target Deployment (required)
#   NAMESPACE      default team1; also written into the plugin config as its
#                  identity namespace (lineage.self.namespace on every span)
#   SELF_ID        lineage identity (default: DEPLOY)
#   APP_CONTAINER  the app container to switch propagation on (optional)
# Env — inherited by attach-lineage.sh and validated there (see its header):
#   APP_IMAGE, OTEL_ENDPOINT, CAPTURE_IO (content capture, off unless true),
#   MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES (cap on a captured value; plugin default 4096, -1 = whole),
#   SIDECAR_IMAGE, PROXY_INIT_IMAGE, NO_EMIT,
#   OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE (an app's OWN telemetry port, or a plaintext non-HTTP store
#                   port such as Postgres/SMTP — never LLM/tool/S3 ports),
#   AUTH_ISSUER [AUTH_AUDIENCE] [AUTH_JWKS_URL] (the user gate: inbound requests
#                   must carry a valid bearer token, and the spans then carry
#                   lineage.principal.sub — for the workload users call directly).
#
# Requires in the namespace: the platform's `envoy-config` ConfigMap; the
# sidecar + proxy-init images resolvable from the cluster (README "Prerequisites and configuration").
#
# Structure: read_inputs → preconditions (six, read-only; each returns or exits) →
# note_capture_only → apply (the only cluster writes). gen() is the one bridge
# to the generator.
