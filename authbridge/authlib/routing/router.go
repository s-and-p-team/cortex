//
//   - an empty or whitespace-only host pattern. A route whose `host:` key is
//     missing from routes.yaml compiles into a pattern that matches only the
//     empty Host header, i.e. never matches real traffic.
//   - a route made unreachable by an earlier one. Resolution is
//     first-match-wins, so a broad early pattern — a "***" typo, or a plain
//     "*", which matches every short in-cluster service name — swallows every
//     route beneath it. If the shadowing route is a passthrough, token
//     exchange is silently off for hosts the operator explicitly listed.
//
// A match-all pattern is NOT rejected outright the way skip_hosts rejects
// one: as the last route it is a legitimate catch-all, equivalent to
// defaultAction but stated explicitly. Only shadowing is an error, which
// means this check can never reject a config that was working — a shadowed
// route was already dead.
