// Package lineage provides the lineage-telemetry authbridge plugin.
//
// Two-span model (see authbridge/docs/lineage-wire-contract.md — the wire
// contract this file implements, kept byte-identical with the consumer's copy
// in the lab-data-governance repo). Each HTTP exchange through the sidecar
// produces TWO OTLP spans:
//
//   - a request span, emitted as soon as the request has been seen and
//     forwarded, carrying caller-side facts + input.value; and
//   - a response span, emitted at stream end (even when no response was
//     produced), carrying status/outcome facts + output.value.
//
// Both spans are ended immediately at emission — no span is held open across
// the wait. lineage.exchange.id (= the request span's own span id) is echoed
// on both so the consumer pairs them. The plugin emits FACTS ONLY (direction,
// protocol, endpoints, parsed payloads); all vocabulary — hop kinds, entity
// kinds, caller/callee — lives in the consumer's classify(). See the "removed
// vs today" migration map in the contract for the attrs this no longer emits.
//
// The plugin implements Finisher so the response span is emitted at stream
// end whatever the outcome — including denials that happen AFTER the request
// span was recorded (a response-phase deny, or a request-phase deny by a
// plugin ordered after this one); pctx.Outcome() is available at that point
// and maps to lineage.outcome=denied + lineage.denied_by. LIMITATION: the
// pipeline YAML places this plugin after the gate plugins (ordering is not
// soft-declared under this capabilities model — position in the list is the
// contract), and the pipeline short-circuits on a request-phase Reject,
// so an exchange denied by a gate BEFORE OnRequest ran emits NO spans at all —
// it is invisible to lineage. Moving lineage ahead of the gates (spans for
// denied traffic too) is a named follow-up, not current behavior.
//
// What this producer writes onto forwarded requests — two things, both
// directions. Always: one tracestate member (tracestateStampKey) so the next
// lineage element can parent its exchange on this one. Only when the request
// carried no VALID traceparent — absent, empty or malformed, as the W3C
// propagator judges it: a traceparent naming this request span
// (mintTraceparent, config mint_traceparent, default on), because without one
// the next element has nothing to extract and the stamp has nothing to ride
// on. A valid traceparent is never modified; an invalid one is replaced, which
// is W3C's processing model for it (restart the trace, drop tracestate).
//
// Read-only variant ("Option 4"). A deployment that wants a pure observer —
// no header written, parenting on the wire context alone — sets
// mint_traceparent: false and deletes exactly the selectParent and
// restampTracestate calls in OnRequest (and the lineage.parent.source fact);
// the span emit itself stays. The trade-off: without the stamp, two sidecarred
// pods can only be joined through the app's own propagation, so cross-pod
// parenting degrades to whatever the wire parent carries. The call site is
// marked so the choice stays locatable; the variant is not built here.

// tracestateStampKey is the W3C tracestate member that carries the sidecar
// parent chain — the single channel every lineage element reads its parent
// from and writes its own request span id into (wire contract v1.5). Inbound
// stamps the request it forwards to its own app; the app's propagate-only shim
// carries tracestate through its per-request causal chain (contextvars), so
// the member surfaces on exactly the outbound calls that inbound caused.
// Outbound re-stamps the request it forwards to the peer, whose inbound
// sidecar reads it as its parent. Parent precedence is stamp > wire parent >
// none (nothing valid on the wire: the span roots a trace) in BOTH
// directions, and the chosen source is recorded as the
// lineage.parent.source fact. The forwarded traceparent is never modified:
// the sidecar chain lives entirely in this member, so an app that emits its
// own spans keeps an intact traceparent chain toward its own backend while
// the sidecar chain stays self-consistent in ours. (Until v1.4 the outbound
// instead rewrote the forwarded traceparent — the splice; v1.5 removed it.)
// The one exception: a request that arrived with no valid traceparent is
// forwarded with one naming this request span (mintTraceparent), so this
// member has a header to ride on — W3C reads tracestate only alongside a
// valid traceparent.
//
// The key is producer-owned and names the lineage domain (W3C convention: the
// key identifies the owner of the entry): the member carries the sidecar
// chain's own parent link and names no consumer. It was `kglin` until
// 2026-08-04 and `dg-parent` until 2026-09-03; the name never lands in stored
// data, so renaming is wire-only — but every sidecar on a hop must run the
// same key, so it changes in one release.
//
// A trace-keyed map (one entry per trace, "the last inbound seen") used to sit
// between the two. It was removed: its answer is correct only while exactly one
// inbound of that trace is in flight — a precondition it never checked and could
// not verify — and when it was wrong it produced a real, exported, walkable
// parent that was simply untrue. Un-stamped traffic falls to the wire
// parent, which is an app-internal span this pipeline never exported: the
// interaction still derives in full, but as a trace entry rather than a child.
