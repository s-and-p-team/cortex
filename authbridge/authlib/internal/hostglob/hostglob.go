// Package hostglob is the one place cortex turns an operator-supplied host
// pattern into a matcher, and the one place that decides what counts as a
// dangerously broad pattern.
//
// Three packages match a destination Host against operator patterns:
//
//   - listener/skiphost      — a match bypasses the pipeline AND session recording
//   - routing                — a match selects token-exchange parameters
//   - plugins/tokenbroker    — a match selects broker parameters
//
// Each of them used to call glob.Compile(pattern, '.') itself and reason about
// breadth on its own. That duplication is why skiphost's footgun guard could
// compare against the literal strings "*" and "**" and miss "***", "{**}",
// "{*,**}" and "?*", and why the other two had no breadth check at all. One
// definition here means a fix or an upgrade lands once.
//
// The package deliberately depends on nothing inside authlib, so every
// consumer — listener, routing, plugins — can import it without any risk of
// an import cycle.
