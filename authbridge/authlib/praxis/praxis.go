// Package praxis converts an AuthBridge [config.Config] into a Praxis
// proxy configuration (https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis).
//
// The two proxies solve overlapping problems with different vocabularies.
// AuthBridge describes a sidecar as a mode plus a set of listener addresses,
// and hangs behavior off an ordered plugin pipeline (inbound and outbound).
// Praxis describes a proxy as a list of bound listeners, each referencing
// named filter chains, where the chain terminates in a router that selects a
// cluster and a load_balancer that resolves that cluster to endpoints.
//
// The mapping this package implements:
//
//	AuthBridge                            Praxis
//	───────────────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────────
//	listener.reverse_proxy_addr           listeners[name=inbound].address
//	listener.reverse_proxy_backend (URL)  load_balancer cluster endpoint
//	listener.transparent_inbound_addr     listeners[name=inbound].address
//	listener.forward_proxy_addr           listeners[name=outbound].address
//	stats.address (host only)             admin.address (host + port 9091)
//	/healthz, /readyz (:9091)             admin /healthy, /ready
//	mtls.mode=permissive                  tls.client_cert_mode=request
//	mtls.mode=strict                      tls.client_cert_mode=require
//	spiffe mirror files                   tls.certificates / tls.client_ca
//	pipeline.inbound.plugins              filter chain (see below)
//	pipeline.outbound.plugins             filter chain (see below)
//
// # Plugin translation and its limits
//
// Praxis's default cargo build (`cargo run -p praxis-proxy`, features
// `default = []`) compiles in no JWT-validation or RFC 8693 token-exchange
// filter. Praxis does ship a `policy` filter whose description covers exactly
// that ground — "multi-source JWT identity, APL route policy, RFC 8693 token
// exchange" — but it sits behind the off-by-default `policy-engine` cargo
// feature and is driven by a separate operator-supplied policy document
// rather than by fields inline in the proxy config. A default-feature binary
// rejects it outright:
//
//	invalid configuration: unknown filter type: 'policy'
//
// Praxis also validates each filter's fields strictly (unknown field on a
// filter entry is a hard error), so there is no way to smuggle AuthBridge's
// per-plugin config through as extra keys.
//
// This converter therefore translates faithfully rather than optimistically.
// Plugins with a real structural counterpart are emitted as Praxis filters
// (see [pluginFilters]); plugins whose enforcement has no default-build
// equivalent are recorded as comments in the generated YAML and returned in
// [Result.Unmapped]. Callers that need the auth enforcement itself should
// build Praxis with `--features policy-engine` and supply a policy document;
// see [Result.Unmapped] for the list to carry across.
//
// The output is designed so that
//
//	cargo run -p praxis-proxy -- -c /tmp/praxis-config.yaml
//
// parses it, passes Praxis's own validation (`praxis -t`), and proxies
// traffic to the same backend AuthBridge would have forwarded to.
