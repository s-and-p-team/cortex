// engine enforces.
//
// The `policy` filter requires Praxis to be built with the `policy-engine`
// cargo feature:
//
//	cargo run --features policy-engine -p praxis-proxy -- -c /tmp/praxis-config.yaml
//

// 'policy'", so [Convert] only emits it when a policy document is actually
// being generated alongside — see [Options.PolicyPath].
