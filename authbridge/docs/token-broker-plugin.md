# Token Broker Plugin

The `token-broker` plugin acquires tokens from an external Token Broker service
on behalf of outbound requests. It replaces the caller's bearer token with one
issued by the broker for the target service.

Note: This plugin is an alternative to token-exchange, not a complement — a given outbound chain should use one or the other, since both replace the outbound Authorization header.

**Flow**:
1. Client sends request with JWT to AuthBridge
2. AuthBridge extracts the bearer token and derives the target server URL from the outbound host
3. AuthBridge calls Token Broker with the bearer token and target server URL
4. Token Broker acquires token (may block waiting for user authorization)
5. AuthBridge replaces JWT with acquired token and forwards to target

## Use Case

Human-in-the-loop OAuth flows where the broker manages user consent and token
caching. The plugin blocks until the broker returns a token (up to 300s to
allow for interactive user login).

AuthBridge does **not** cache brokered tokens locally. It sends a broker request
for each outbound request that matches a `broker` route. The Token Broker service
is therefore expected to cache and reuse tokens when appropriate (for example,
using the same subject token, target server, and scope inputs to avoid repeated
interactive flows and unnecessary upstream traffic).

**Example**: Your application calls GitHub API on behalf of users, but GitHub
OAuth requires a browser-based authorization flow. The Token Broker handles this
interaction transparently — application code remains unchanged.

## Configuration

```yaml
pipeline:
  outbound:
    plugins:
      - name: token-broker
        config:
          broker_url: "http://token-broker:8080"    # Required
          default_policy: "passthrough"              # "broker" or "passthrough" (default)
          routes:
            file: "/etc/authproxy/routes.yaml"      # Optional
            rules:                                   # Optional inline rules
              - host: "api.github.com"
                action: "broker"
                authorization_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize"
                token_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
              - host: "mcp-server"
                action: "broker"
              - host: "internal-*"
                action: "passthrough"
```

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `broker_url` | Yes | — | Base URL of the Token Broker service |
| `default_policy` | No | `passthrough` | Action for hosts matching no route |
| `routes.file` | No | — | Path to a routes YAML file |
| `routes.rules` | No | — | Inline route entries |

### Route Rules

Each rule has a `host` (glob pattern), an `action` (`"broker"` or `"passthrough"`),
and optional `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint` fields.
Rules with no explicit action default to `"broker"`.

Host matching strips the port before comparison (`api.example.com:8443` matches
pattern `api.example.com`). First match wins. When both file routes and inline rules are configured, file routes are evaluated first and take priority.

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `host` | Yes | — | Glob pattern to match target host |
| `action` | No | `broker` | `"broker"` to acquire token, `"passthrough"` to skip |
| `authorization_endpoint` | No | — | OAuth authorization endpoint URL to send to broker |
| `token_endpoint` | No | — | OAuth token endpoint URL to send to broker |

### Routes File Format

```yaml
# /etc/authproxy/routes.yaml
- host: "api.github.com"
  action: "broker"
  authorization_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize"
  token_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
- host: "*.github.com"
  action: "broker"
  authorization_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize"
  token_endpoint: "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
- host: "internal-service"
  action: "passthrough"
```

The `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint` fields are optional. When provided,
they will be sent to the Token Broker service via the `X-Authorization-Endpoint` and
`X-Token-Endpoint` headers respectively, allowing the broker to use static,
pre-configured OAuth endpoints.

### Pipeline Composition

Token Broker can be composed with other plugins in the outbound pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
  outbound:
    plugins:
      - name: token-exchange   # Handles exchange routes (service-to-service)
      - name: token-broker     # Handles broker routes (user-delegated)
```

## Broker Protocol

The plugin performs a fresh `POST {broker_url}/sessions/token` for each outbound
request that is routed to the broker. Broker implementations are expected to own
token reuse and TTL-based caching behavior.

### Endpoint

```
POST {broker_url}/sessions/token
```

### Request Headers

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <caller-token>` | The original request's JWT |
| `X-Server-Url` | `{scheme}://{host}` | Target service URL (scheme derived from request) |
| `X-Authorization-Endpoint` | `{authorization-url}` | Optional: OAuth authorization endpoint from route config |
| `X-Token-Endpoint` | `{token-url}` | Optional: OAuth token endpoint from route config |

The `X-Authorization-Endpoint` and `X-Token-Endpoint` headers are only sent when the
matched route specifies these endpoints. This allows the broker to use the correct OAuth
endpoints for the target service.

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "token": "gho_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

### Error Responses

| Status | Meaning | AuthBridge Action |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 401 | Invalid/expired JWT | Returns 401 to client |
| 403 | User denied authorization | Returns 403 to client |
| 408 | Token acquisition timeout | Returns 408 to client |
| 5xx | Service error | Returns 502 Bad Gateway |

### Timeout Behavior

- **Token Broker timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) — allows for user login
- **AuthBridge client timeout**: 310 seconds (broker times out first)
- Broker blocks until token is available or timeout occurs

### Caching Responsibility

Caching is intentionally delegated to the Token Broker service rather than
implemented in the plugin. This keeps AuthBridge stateless for brokered token
acquisition while allowing the broker to apply the correct reuse policy for
interactive OAuth tokens.

Operationally, this means:

- AuthBridge will call `POST /sessions/token` on every matching outbound request
- The broker should cache and reuse valid tokens whenever safe to do so
- The broker should avoid re-triggering user authorization flows when an
  existing valid token can be returned

## Comparison with Token Exchange

| Feature | Token Exchange | Token Broker |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Protocol** | OAuth2 Token Exchange (RFC 8693) | Custom HTTP API |
| **Latency** | Low (~100ms) | High (seconds to minutes) |
| **User Interaction** | No | Yes (may require browser) |
| **Use Case** | Service-to-service | User-delegated access |
| **Examples** | Keycloak, Auth0 | GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth |

## Route Action Semantics

The `action` field in token-broker routes uses `"broker"` / `"passthrough"`.
The token-broker plugin has its own internal router implementation optimized
for broker-specific routing needs. Routes with action `"broker"` (or no explicit
action, which defaults to `"broker"`) will trigger token acquisition from the
broker service. Routes with action `"passthrough"` will forward requests unchanged.

The router uses glob pattern matching (via `gobwas/glob`) with first-match-wins
semantics, and automatically strips ports from hosts before matching.

## Debugging

Enable debug logging to see broker operations:

```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/myapp -c authbridge-proxy
```

Example log output:
```
level=WARN msg="token-broker: broker returned error" status=403 error=access_denied description="insufficient permissions"
level=ERROR msg="token-broker: broker request failed" error="token broker request failed: context deadline exceeded"
```

**Common issues**:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 401 at client | Missing bearer token on outbound request | Ensure app sets Authorization header |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Broker service unreachable | Check broker pod health and networking |
| 408 timeout | User didn't complete login within 300s | User must retry; check broker UI |

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT forwarding**: The inbound bearer token is forwarded to the broker — use TLS for `broker_url` in production
2. **Target binding**: The derived server URL is sent via `X-Server-Url` so the broker can scope tokens appropriately
3. **Token scope**: Token Broker should issue tokens with minimum necessary scopes
4. **Audit**: Token Broker should log all token acquisitions for audit trail
