#!/usr/bin/env bash
# attach-lineage.sh — the one generator. Given a Deployment's NAME (and,
# optionally, which of its containers to switch propagation on and with which
# image), print ONE of the two objects that attach lineage to it:
#
#   EMIT=patch (default)  strategic-merge patch adding the sidecar pieces —
#                         proxy-init initContainer, envoy-proxy container, two
#                         config volumes — and, with APP_CONTAINER, the
#                         propagation switch on the app's own container.
#   EMIT=cm               the per-app plugin ConfigMap the sidecar mounts
#                         (parser chain + lineage-telemetry entry).
#
# Apply both and the app's traffic flows through the lineage plugin. The app
# itself is never described: no Deployment, no Service, no app config — lists
# merge by name, so nothing the owner wrote changes. Stdout only; this script
# never touches the cluster.
#
# Consumed by sidecar-patch.sh (live: checks, applies both, waits) or by your
# own kustomization (the cm under resources:, the patch under patches: with
# target kind Deployment / name NAME) — see README.md "How to attach".
#
# Propagation: capture alone cannot attribute an app's outbound calls to the
# inbound that caused them. The sidecar forwards the trace context (a
# traceparent when none arrived, plus its own tracestate stamp), but only code
# running inside the request can carry it from the inbound to the outbound
# calls it causes — the app must do that itself. For an
# uninstrumented Python app, bake the shim first (build-otel-shim.sh), then
# pass APP_CONTAINER (+ APP_IMAGE): the patch sets LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1 on that
# container, which wakes the baked hook. Without APP_CONTAINER the patch is
# capture-only and the app container is not touched.
#
# Usage:
#   NAME=echo-upstream ./attach-lineage.sh                     # the patch
#   NAME=echo-upstream EMIT=cm ./attach-lineage.sh             # the ConfigMap
#   NAME=my-agent APP_CONTAINER=agent \
#     APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/my-agent-otel:latest ./attach-lineage.sh
#
# Variables:
#   NAME            (required) the target Deployment; also names the ConfigMap
#                   (authbridge-lineage-config-NAME) and defaults SELF_ID
#   NAMESPACE       default team1
#   SELF_ID         lineage identity on every span (default NAME)
#   APP_CONTAINER   the app container to set LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1 on. MUST name
#                   an existing container: a strategic merge ADDS a stub for an
#                   unknown name. Checked by sidecar-patch.sh, not here.
#   APP_IMAGE       needs APP_CONTAINER: the -otel image to set on it
#   OTEL_ENDPOINT   OTLP/gRPC target for the plugin's spans (default: the
#                   platform collector). Any OTLP consumer works. Plain gRPC
#                   unless it starts with https://.
#   CAPTURE_IO      false (default, the plugin's own) | true — whether the spans
#                   carry the parsed content (input.value / output.value:
#                   prompts, tool arguments, messages). PII-bearing: opt in.
#   MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES  cap on a captured value (plugin default 4096 when unset;
#                   -1 = attach whole). Only meaningful with CAPTURE_IO=true.
#   OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE  ports proxy-init must not intercept — an app's OWN
#                   telemetry export port (e.g. 4317), or a plaintext non-HTTP
#                   store (Postgres 5432, SMTP 1025: the outbound HTTP codec
#                   would close them). Never LLM/tool/S3 ports.
#   SIDECAR_IMAGE   default ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/authbridge-envoy:latest —
#                   UNTIL A RELEASE CARRIES lineage-telemetry (cortex #761) it
#                   boots without the plugin; build from a tree that has it and
#                   point this at your tag (RECIPE.md step 1)
#   PROXY_INIT_IMAGE  default ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/proxy-init:latest
#   NO_EMIT=1       omit the plugin entry: the sidecar proxies, emits nothing
#                   (parsers alone are legal). The A/B baseline.
#   EMIT            patch (default) | cm
#
# Structure: parse_inputs validates EVERY knob (all refusals live there);
# build_* each assemble one optional YAML fragment into a global; the three
# fragment functions are the single source of the sidecar YAML; emit()
# dispatches to the two emitters.
