# Recipe — attach lineage to a running Deployment

A step-by-step for an operator or a coding agent. Every step is one command,
the one line of output that means it worked, and what to do when it did not.
Run from this directory. The explanations are in [README.md](README.md); the
reasons behind them in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

**Inputs.** `NS` — the namespace · `DEPLOY` — the Deployment · `CONTAINER` —
the name of its app container (`kubectl -n $NS get deploy/$DEPLOY -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}'`)
· `IMAGE` — that container's image, present locally under the name the engine knows it by (a podman build of
`my-agent:latest` is `localhost/my-agent:latest`; a bare name is asked of the engine first, then taken as `docker.io/library/<name>`).

## 0. Preconditions (read-only)

| check | command | pass |
|---|---|---|
| the Deployment exists and is not platform-enrolled | `kubectl -n $NS get deploy $DEPLOY -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.initContainers[*].name} {.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}'` | prints the app container(s) only — no `proxy-init`, no `envoy-proxy` |
| the platform rendered the sidecar's config here | `kubectl -n $NS get cm envoy-config` | found |
| the app's image is local (for the bake) | `podman image exists $IMAGE` (docker: `docker image inspect $IMAGE >/dev/null`) | exit 0 |
| an OTLP/gRPC collector is reachable in-cluster | `kubectl -n rossoctl-system get deploy otel-collector` | found (else set `OTEL_ENDPOINT` in step 3) |

Enrolled workloads (an `AgentRuntime` CR) already carry a sidecar: this recipe
refuses them by design; see README "Enrolled workloads".

## 1. A sidecar image that carries the plugin (once per cluster, until a release does)

The plugin is cortex #761: build from a tree that carries `authbridge/authlib/plugins/lineage/`
(`main` once #761 has merged; the #761 branch until then).

```sh
( cd .. && podman build -f cmd/authbridge-envoy/Dockerfile -t docker.io/library/authbridge-envoy:latest . \
            && podman build -f proxy-init/Dockerfile.init -t docker.io/library/proxy-init:latest proxy-init/ )
for ref in authbridge-envoy proxy-init; do podman save docker.io/library/$ref:latest -o /tmp/$ref.tar \
  && KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER=podman kind load image-archive /tmp/$ref.tar --name rossoctl; rm -f /tmp/$ref.tar; done
export SIDECAR_IMAGE=docker.io/library/authbridge-envoy:latest PROXY_INIT_IMAGE=docker.io/library/proxy-init:latest
```

Pass: `podman exec <kind-node> crictl images | grep -E 'library/(authbridge-envoy|proxy-init)'` lists both.
Docker hosts: `docker build` with the same `-f`/`-t`, then `kind load docker-image <ref> --name rossoctl`.
Skip this step once the published `ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/authbridge-envoy` carries `lineage-telemetry`;
the symptom of skipping it too early is the sidecar crash-looping with `unknown plugin "lineage-telemetry"`.

## 2. Bake the propagation shim onto the app image (once per image)

```sh
KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=rossoctl ./build-otel-shim.sh $IMAGE
```

Pass: last line `>> loaded docker.io/library/<name>-otel:latest into kind cluster rossoctl`
(exit 0; the attestation runs before the load and prints nothing when it passes).
Fail `REFUSING to bake … already instruments …` (exit 3): the app instruments itself — go to step 3 **without** `APP_CONTAINER`/`APP_IMAGE` (capture only).
Fail `REFUSING to bake … no runnable Python found` (exit 3): outside the shim's envelope (DESIGN "The envelope") — same, capture only; or pass the interpreter as arg 3 if you know it.
Fail `REFUSING to bake … is not present locally` (exit 3): wrong `IMAGE` — see Inputs; nothing was built.
Fail `ATTESTATION FAILED` (exit 4): the bake itself is broken (the image was not loaded) — read the assertion it prints; not an app property.

## 3. Attach (once per Deployment)

```sh
NAMESPACE=$NS DEPLOY=$DEPLOY APP_CONTAINER=$CONTAINER APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/<name>-otel:latest ./sidecar-patch.sh
```

Add `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE=5432,1025` (comma-separated) if the app speaks a plaintext **non-HTTP**
protocol to a store — Postgres, SMTP, Redis. Never exclude LLM, tool, peer or S3 ports.
Set `OTEL_ENDPOINT=host:port` for a collector other than the platform's.

Pass — the output ends with:
```
>> back out: kubectl -n <ns> rollout undo deploy/<deploy> --to-revision=<n> && kubectl -n <ns> delete cm authbridge-lineage-config-<deploy>
deployment "<deploy>" successfully rolled out
>> lineage sidecar attached to deploy/<deploy> (self_id=<deploy>, ns=<ns>)
```
(preceded by `configmap/authbridge-lineage-config-<deploy> created` and `deployment.apps/<deploy> patched`;
the back-out line is printed before the rollout wait so it is there even when the wait fails).
Add `CAPTURE_IO=true` to attach the parsed content — prompts, tool arguments, messages — to the spans (off by default; PII).
Fail `already has a container named` / `already declares containerPort` → enrolled or colliding workload (README "How to attach").
Fail `has no container named` → wrong `APP_CONTAINER`; nothing was applied.
Rollout stuck → run the back-out line printed above, then read the sidecar log (step 4).

## 4. Verify

```sh
kubectl -n $NS logs deploy/$DEPLOY -c envoy-proxy | grep 'lineage-telemetry: initialized'
```
Pass: `… endpoint=<otel_endpoint> self_id=<deploy>`.

Then one request **from inside the cluster** (a port-forward bypasses the sidecar) with a trace id you choose:
```sh
T=$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(16))')
kubectl -n $NS run drive --rm -i --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl:8.11.1 -- \
  curl -s -H "traceparent: 00-$T-0000000000000001-01" http://<service>:<port>/<path>    # any request the app answers
kubectl -n rossoctl-system logs deploy/otel-collector | grep -c "$T"
```
Pass: a count ≥ 2 (one request span + one response span per exchange the app took part in).
Attribution check, when the app calls out: every hop after the entry must show
`lineage.parent.source: tracestate`; a `none` (or `wire`) on a non-entry hop is an un-propagated call
(DESIGN "Why the shim is needed").

## 5. Back out

```sh
kubectl -n $NS rollout undo deploy/$DEPLOY --to-revision=<n> && kubectl -n $NS delete cm authbridge-lineage-config-$DEPLOY
```
`<n>` is the revision step 3 printed in its last line — the spec as it was before the attach. A bare
`rollout undo` goes one step back, which is that spec only if nothing rolled the Deployment since;
`kubectl -n $NS rollout history deploy/$DEPLOY` lists the revisions if the line is gone. Delete the
ConfigMap after the undo, not before: a revision that still mounts it cannot start without it.

## A fleet

Bake once per image, attach once per Deployment; two loops. Then check the **shape** of one trace
(one root, unstamped only at the entry), not just that spans arrived.

```sh
for img in agent-a agent-b tool-x; do KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=rossoctl ./build-otel-shim.sh docker.io/library/$img:latest; done
for d in agent-a agent-b tool-x; do
  NAMESPACE=$NS DEPLOY=$d APP_CONTAINER=app APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/$d-otel:latest ./sidecar-patch.sh
done
```
