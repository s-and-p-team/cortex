# Component PRD: Event Broker

## Description

A NATS JetStream pod that decouples event producers from the AIAC Agent. Producers (Keycloak SPI listener, Policy Ingest Service) publish lightweight trigger events to named NATS subjects. The AIAC Agent subscribes as a durable competing consumer, guaranteeing at-least-once delivery and automatic replay of unprocessed events after pod restarts.

The Event Broker is a single-node NATS JetStream instance. It owns no business logic — it is a pure transport layer. All policy decisions, orchestration, and state remain in the AIAC Agent.

## Stream Configuration

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Stream name | `aiac-events` |
| Subjects | `aiac.apply.>` |
| Retention policy | `WorkQueuePolicy` — message deleted from stream after acknowledgement |
| Consumer name | `aiac-agent-consumer` |
| Consumer type | Durable push consumer with queue group (competing consumers) |
| Authentication | None — ClusterIP network isolation is the access control mechanism |
| Dead-letter subject | `aiac.apply.dlq` |
| Max delivery attempts | 5 — message routed to DLQ after 5 unacknowledged redeliveries |

---

## Subjects

| Subject | Publisher | Consumer | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aiac.apply.service.{id}` | Keycloak SPI listener | AIAC Agent | Keycloak `CLIENT_CREATED` event |
| `aiac.apply.role.{id}` | Keycloak SPI listener | AIAC Agent | Keycloak role created/updated |
| `aiac.apply.policy.build` | Policy Ingest Service | AIAC Agent | Post-ingest completion (any collection) |
| `aiac.apply.dlq` | NATS JetStream (automatic) | Operator (manual inspection) | Max delivery attempts exceeded |

**`rebuild` is not routed through the Event Broker.** It is an operator-only command issued directly via `POST /apply/policy/rebuild` on the AIAC Agent using `kubectl port-forward`.

---

## Message Payload

All messages carry a minimal JSON payload containing only the entity ID:

```json
{ "id": "<entity-id>" }
```

For `aiac.apply.policy.build`, the payload is empty (`{}`). The AIAC Agent pulls all required state from the IdP Configuration Service at processing time — the event payload is a trigger, not a data carrier.

---

## Delivery Guarantees

- **At-least-once delivery** — NATS redelivers any message not acknowledged within the `AckWait` window.
- **Exactly-one processing** — the Agent subscribes via a queue group (`aiac-agent-consumer`). Only one Agent pod receives each message; other pods in the group are not notified.
- **Replay on restart** — `WorkQueuePolicy` retains all unacknowledged messages. A restarted Agent pod automatically receives pending messages on reconnection.
- **DLQ on repeated failure** — after 5 unacknowledged redeliveries, NATS routes the message to `aiac.apply.dlq` for operator inspection. No message is silently dropped.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `NATS_URL` | `nats://aiac-event-broker-service:4222` | ConfigMap (`aiac-pdp-config`) |

No authentication credentials are required. The NATS server runs with no-auth configuration.

---

## Runtime

- Image: `nats:latest` with JetStream enabled (`-js` flag)
- Bind: `0.0.0.0:4222` (NATS client port)
- Kubernetes ClusterIP service: `aiac-event-broker-service:4222`
- Base image: official `nats` Docker image

## Kubernetes Manifest

## AIAC Init Container

A dedicated `aiac-init` init container runs in the **Agent Pod** before the Agent container starts. It orchestrates the AIAC startup sequence. _Deployment of this container is deferred to Phase 2 (issue 4.21) — the Phase 1 Agent pod runs without it._

1. **Wait for NATS** — poll `aiac-event-broker-service:4222` until TCP connection succeeds.
2. **Wait for IdP Configuration Service** — poll `AIAC_PDP_CONFIG_URL/health` until HTTP 200.
3. **Wait for PDP Policy Writer** — poll `AIAC_PDP_POLICY_URL/health` until HTTP 200.
4. **Wait for the Policy Ingest Service** — poll `AIAC_POLICY_INGEST_URL/health` until HTTP 200.
5. **Wait for the Policy Store (ChromaDB)** — poll `AIAC_POLICY_STORE_URL` until its TCP listener accepts. ChromaDB is now a **separate pod** (the Policy Store Pod), so the ingest service being healthy no longer implies ChromaDB is up — it must be probed independently. (ChromaDB has no `/health` path, so this is a TCP-connect check on `aiac-policy-store-service:8000`.)
6. **Create NATS JetStream stream** — call `js.add_stream()` idempotently with the `aiac-events` stream configuration. Safe to call on every restart. _Like the rest of this init container, the Event Broker and this stream-provisioning path are **deferred (not Phase 1)** — the Phase 1 Agent pod does not run the Event Broker or provision the JetStream stream, consistent with the PRD out-of-scope list._

The init container uses `python:3.12-slim` with `nats-py` and `httpx`. It is version-controlled alongside the Agent. All dependency URLs are read from the `aiac-pdp-config` ConfigMap.

### Init Container Configuration

| `AIAC_PDP_CONFIG_URL` | ConfigMap (`aiac-pdp-config`) | `http://aiac-pdp-config-service:7071` |
| `AIAC_PDP_POLICY_URL` | ConfigMap (`aiac-pdp-config`) | `http://aiac-pdp-policy-service:7072` |
| `AIAC_POLICY_INGEST_URL` | ConfigMap (`aiac-pdp-config`) | `http://aiac-policy-ingest-service:7073` |
| `AIAC_POLICY_STORE_URL` | ConfigMap (`aiac-pdp-config`) | `http://aiac-policy-store-service:8000` |

## Testing

| Target | What to mock | What to assert |
|---|---|---|
| Init container health-check loop | HTTP 4xx then 200 sequence; ChromaDB TCP refused then connected | Exits 0 only after all five dependencies respond healthy (NATS, IdP Config, PDP Policy, Policy Ingest, Policy Store) |
| Init container stream creation | NATS JetStream `add_stream` call | Called with correct stream name, subjects, and retention policy; idempotent on second call |
| Agent NATS consumer dispatch | NATS message delivery | Correct `/apply/*` handler invoked for each subject pattern; message acked on success; message not acked on handler exception |
| DLQ routing | NATS max redelivery exceeded | Message appears on `aiac.apply.dlq` after 5 failures |
