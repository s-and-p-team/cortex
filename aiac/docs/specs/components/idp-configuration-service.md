# Component PRD: IdP Configuration Service

## Location
`aiac/src/aiac/idp/service/configuration/keycloak/`

## Description
A FastAPI web service that proxies Keycloak Admin REST API endpoints. Returns IdP (Keycloak) entity state in generic form for consumption by the AIAC Agent and library clients. Consolidates all Keycloak interactions into a single container. Stateless — no caching. Backed exclusively by Keycloak.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Keycloak Admin API call | Description |
|--------|------|------------------------|-------------|
| GET | `/subjects` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/users` | All subjects (users) in realm; filtered to subjects with a specific role when `role_id` query param is provided |
| GET | `/roles` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/roles` (full representation, `brief_representation=False`) | All realm-level roles, including attributes (so the `aiac.managed` marker is visible) |
| GET | `/subjects/{subject_id}/assignments` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/users/{subject_id}/role-mappings` | Realm and service permission assignments for a subject |
| GET | `/services` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/clients` | All services (clients) |
| GET | `/services/{service_id}` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/clients/{service_id}` | Single service by ID |
| POST | `/services/{service_id}/type` | `admin.get_client(service_id)` → `admin.update_client(service_id, {"attributes": {...}})` | Set a service's type via the `client.type` client attribute |
| GET | `/scopes` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/client-scopes` | All scopes |
| GET | `/services/{service_id}/roles` | `admin.get_client_roles(service_id)` **+** `aiac.managed` realm roles on the service account | **An agent's own roles (`R_A`)** from **two** sources: this service's client roles, **plus** the `aiac.managed` realm roles assigned to its service account (the `Configuration` library's provisioning path). Both surfaced as `kind = Agent`. See "Agent roles are client roles" below. |
| GET | `/services/{service_id}/scopes` | `admin.get_client_default_client_scopes(service_id)` | Default client scopes assigned to a service |
| GET | `/roles/{role_name}/composites` | `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/roles/{role-name}/composites` | Current composite permissions assigned to a role |
| POST | `/scopes` | `POST /admin/realms/{realm}/client-scopes` | Create realm-level scope |
| POST | `/services/{service_id}/scopes/{scope_id}` | `PUT /admin/realms/{realm}/default-default-client-scopes/{scope_id}` | Assign existing scope as default scope to service |
| POST | `/roles` | `POST /admin/realms/{realm}/roles` | Create realm-level role |
| POST | `/services/{service_id}/roles/{role_id}` | `admin.get_client_service_account_user(service_id)` → `admin.assign_realm_roles(user_id, ...)` | Assign existing realm role to service account |
| GET | `/services/{service_id}/discovery-token` | `admin.get_client(service_id)` → (idempotent) `add_mapper_to_client` → `KeycloakOpenID(...).token(grant_type="client_credentials")` | Mint a bearer token, minted **as the service's own client**, whose `aud` contains that client's client-id — for authenticating UC-1 tool discovery against the tool's AuthBridge sidecar |
| GET | `/health` | `admin.get_server_info()` — uses `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM`; no `?realm=` param | Readiness probe |

`GET /subjects?role_id={role_id}` (filtered variant):
1. Calls `admin.get_realm_role_by_id(role_id)` to resolve the role name from its ID.
2. Calls `admin.get_realm_role_members(role_name)` (`GET /admin/realms/{realm}/roles/{role-name}/users`) to retrieve users directly assigned to the role.
3. For each returned user, enriches with realm role assignments by calling `GET /subjects/{id}/assignments?realm=<realm>` (same enrichment as the unfiltered `GET /subjects` endpoint).
4. Returns `200 OK` with a JSON array of enriched user objects.
5. Returns `[]` (empty array) when no subject holds the role directly.
6. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`GET /services/{service_id}`:
1. Calls `admin.get_client(service_id)`.
2. Returns `200 OK` with the client JSON on success.
3. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

All service reads (`GET /services`, `GET /services/{service_id}`) return the Keycloak client representation **unmodified**, so client `attributes` — including `client.type` — flow through verbatim for the library's generic-model mapping (`Service._resolve_keycloak_fields`) to resolve service type. The Keycloak attribute name is confined to this service (writes) and the library mapping layer (reads); it is never exposed to library callers.

`POST /services/{service_id}/type`:
Accepts JSON body `{"type": "Agent" | "Tool"}` (rejected with `422` otherwise). It:
1. Calls `admin.get_client(service_id)` and copies its existing `attributes`.
2. Sets the **`client.type`** attribute to the (capitalized, plain-string) type value and calls `admin.update_client(service_id, {"attributes": {...}})`. The existing attributes are merged, not clobbered.
3. Returns `200 OK` with the updated client JSON (re-fetched via `admin.get_client`).
4. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`POST /scopes`:
Accepts JSON body `{"name": ..., "description": ...}`. It:
1. Calls `admin.create_client_scope({"name": ..., "description": ..., "protocol": "openid-connect", "attributes": {"aiac.managed": "true"}})` to create the scope at realm level. The `aiac.managed` attribute is the AIAC provisioning marker (client-scope attribute values are plain strings).
2. Returns `201 Created` with the created scope JSON (`{"id": ..., "name": ..., "description": ...}`).
3. Returns `409 Conflict` if a scope with that name already exists.
4. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`POST /services/{service_id}/scopes/{scope_id}`:
1. Calls `admin.add_default_default_client_scope(service_id, scope_id)` to assign the scope as a default scope to the service.
2. Returns `201 Created` on success.
3. Returns `409 Conflict` if the scope is already assigned to the service.
4. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`POST /roles`:
Accepts JSON body `{"name": ..., "description": ...}`. It:
1. Calls `admin.create_realm_role({"name": ..., "description": ..., "attributes": {"aiac.managed": ["true"]}})` to create the role at realm level. The `aiac.managed` attribute is the AIAC provisioning marker (realm-role attribute values are lists of strings).
2. Returns `201 Created` with the created role JSON (`{"id": ..., "name": ..., "description": ...}`).
3. Returns `409 Conflict` if a role with that name already exists.
4. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`GET /services/{service_id}/roles`: returns this service's agent roles (`R_A` in the PCE
derivation) from **two** sources, both stamped `kind = Agent`, `actorIds = [this client's
serviceId]`:
1. **Client roles** on the service's own client — `admin.get_client_roles(service_id)`. Each
   `RoleRepresentation` carries `clientRole: true` and `containerId` (the client UUID); the owner is
   resolved from `containerId` → `get_client(containerId)["clientId"]`.
2. **`aiac.managed` realm roles assigned to the service account** — `get_client_service_account_user(service_id)`
   → `get_realm_roles_of_user(user_id)`. This is how the `Configuration` library provisions an agent's
   roles (`POST /services/{id}/roles/{role_id}` → `assign_realm_roles` on the service account, below),
   so without it a library-onboarded agent would expose no roles. The role-of-user stub omits
   attributes, so each is re-fetched via `get_realm_role_by_id` to test the `aiac.managed` marker;
   non-managed realm roles (e.g. `default-roles-<realm>`) are skipped. The owner is this service's own
   `clientId`.
3. Returns `200 OK` with the merged JSON array (client-role ids dedup against the realm-role set).
4. Returns `[]` if `KeycloakError` has `response_code == 400` (service has no client roles — not an
   error); a missing service account is caught and simply contributes no realm roles.
5. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on other `KeycloakError`.

> **Redesign note (SPM/APM + provisioning reconciliation).** Under the original SPM/APM redesign this
> endpoint sourced roles **only** from the client's client roles (`admin.get_client_roles`), on the
> premise that an agent's role is always a Keycloak client role (Assumption 3). In practice the write
> path (`POST /services/{id}/roles/{role_id}`, used by the `Configuration` library) assigns a **realm
> role to the service account**, not a client role — so the read and write paths did not meet, and a
> library-provisioned agent exposed no roles (empty `agent_roles` → all-deny outbound Rego; surfaced by
> the 5.3 live pipeline). The endpoint now returns **both** sources so the two paths reconcile. The
> long-term option of making provisioning create true client roles instead is tracked with issue 1.7.

`GET /services/{service_id}/scopes`:
1. Calls `admin.get_client_default_client_scopes(service_id)` to return the realm-level client scopes assigned as defaults to the service.
2. Returns `200 OK` with a JSON array of client scope objects.
3. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`POST /services/{service_id}/roles/{role_id}`:
1. Calls `admin.get_client_service_account_user(service_id)` to get the service account user.
2. Extracts `user["id"]` from the result.
3. Calls `admin.assign_realm_roles(user_id, [{"id": role_id}])` to assign the realm role to the service account.
4. Returns `201 Created` on success.
5. Returns `409 Conflict` if the role is already assigned.
6. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

`GET /services/{service_id}/discovery-token`:
1. Calls `admin.get_client(service_id)` to resolve `client_id = client["clientId"]`.
2. Reads the client's **existing** secret (`client.get("secret")` or `admin.get_client_secrets(service_id)`)
   — **never** calls `generate_client_secrets` (rotating the live secret would break the deployed
   workload). Returns `502 Bad Gateway` if no secret is present (e.g. a public client).
3. Idempotently ensures a self-audience `oidc-audience-mapper` named `aiac-discovery-audience` is
   attached to the client (`get_mappers_from_client` then `add_mapper_to_client` only if absent), so the
   minted token's `aud` includes `client_id`.
4. Mints via `KeycloakOpenID(server_url=..., realm_name=realm, client_id=client_id,
   client_secret_key=secret).token(grant_type="client_credentials")` — i.e. as the **service's own
   client**, not the realm admin.
5. Decodes the minted token's payload (no signature check needed — this endpoint trusts its own mint)
   and asserts `client_id in aud`; if `AIAC_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` is set, also asserts `iss` matches it.
   Returns `502 Bad Gateway` if either assertion fails — this endpoint never returns a token the
   consuming AuthBridge sidecar's `jwt-validation` plugin would reject.
6. Returns `200 OK` with `{"access_token": ..., "client_id": ..., "issuer": ..., "audience": [...]}`.
7. Returns `502 Bad Gateway` with `{"error": ...}` on `KeycloakError`.

All endpoints except `/health` require a `?realm=<realm>` query parameter specifying the Keycloak realm to operate in. Returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` if the parameter is absent. `/health` accepts no realm parameter — it calls `_get_or_create_admin(os.environ["KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM"])` directly.

All GET endpoints return `200 OK` with a JSON array on success, except `/subjects/{subject_id}/assignments` which returns a JSON object with `realmMappings` and `serviceMappings` fields. All endpoints return `502 Bad Gateway` with a JSON error body if the Keycloak Admin API call fails.

### AIAC provisioning marker (`aiac.managed`)

Every role and client scope this service creates is stamped with the Keycloak attribute `aiac.managed` = `true` — the AIAC naming convention that distinguishes AIAC-provisioned entities from Keycloak's own built-ins (default client scopes, the `default-roles-<realm>` composite). Attribute value shape differs by entity: realm-role attribute values are lists (`{"aiac.managed": ["true"]}`), client-scope attribute values are plain strings (`{"aiac.managed": "true"}`). Because Keycloak's brief role representation omits attributes, `GET /roles` requests the full representation so the marker survives the read. Downstream consumers (the Policy Computation Engine's P2 embed) filter on this marker to keep only domain entities.

### Agent roles are client roles, field population, and assumption enforcement (SPM/APM)

Under the SPM/APM policy-model redesign the Policy Computation Engine (PCE) performs **no IdP lookup for routing or classification** — it relies on entities being self-describing (`Role.kind`, `Role.actorIds`, `Scope.serviceId`; the fields are defined in the models spec). The IdP Configuration Service is the **only** layer that sees Keycloak's raw facts, so it is where these fields are populated and where the underlying assumptions are validated. Field definitions live with the models (library) spec; this service **populates** them.

**Assumption 3 — an agent's role is a Keycloak _client role_ (or an `aiac.managed` _realm role_ assigned to the agent's service account); a user's role is a plain Keycloak _realm role_.** In Keycloak a `RoleRepresentation` carries `clientRole: bool` and `containerId` (the client UUID for client roles, the realm id for realm roles). An agent role therefore has **two** valid representations — a client role on the agent's client, or an `aiac.managed` realm role held by the agent's service account (the provisioning path) — and both are classified `kind = Agent`; only a realm role **not** owned by any service account is a `kind = User` role. This service holds the invariant end-to-end:

- **Agent roles.** `GET /services/{service_id}/roles` returns an agent's own roles (`R_A`) from two sources: the client's client roles (`admin.get_client_roles`, `clientRole == true`), **and** the `aiac.managed` realm roles assigned to the service account (the provisioning path the `Configuration` library uses). Both are surfaced as `kind = Agent` owned by this service — see the endpoint description and its Redesign note above.
- **User roles are realm roles.** `GET /roles` continues to read realm-level roles (`kind = User`), excluding the Keycloak-generated `default-roles-<realm>` composite (exact-name match). That composite is the *only* path to Keycloak's built-ins (`offline_access`, `uma_authorization`, `view-profile`, the `account` client roles) — no user holds them directly — so dropping it keeps AIAC policy free of Keycloak built-ins without a per-name blocklist.

**Field population** (in the Keycloak → generic-model mapping layer, from the raw facts above):

- **`Role.kind`** — a role read via `GET /services/{service_id}/roles` is always `kind = Agent` (whether it came from the client's client roles or from an `aiac.managed` realm role on the service account); a realm role read via `GET /roles` is `kind = User`. Equivalently: agent-context (`clientRole == true`, or `aiac.managed` realm role held by a service account) → `Agent`; plain realm role → `User`. Kind is **never** inferred from role naming.
- **`Role.actorIds` per kind:**
  - `Agent`: the owning agent's `serviceId` — resolved from the role's `containerId` → client (`clientId`) — and/or the agent service account(s) that hold the role.
  - `User`: the **member usernames** of the role. This aligns with `GET /subjects?role_id=` / `get_subjects_by_role`, which already resolves a role → its member subjects; the usernames it returns are exactly `actorIds` for a user (realm) role.
- **`Scope.serviceId`** = the **owning client** — the client that defines/exposes the client scope.

**Fail-loud enforcement at this boundary** (detectable here via membership queries; do not silently pick a side):

- **Assumption 1 — no cross-kind role.** A role held by *both* human users and agent service accounts cannot be represented by a single `actorIds` list. On violation, **raise/log** rather than choosing one kind.
- **Assumption 2 — single scope owner.** `get_services_by_scope` returns `list[Service]` (Keycloak client scopes are realm-level and assignable to many clients). For **AIAC-managed** scopes (see the `aiac.managed` marker above) that list must have length 1; if Keycloak reports multiple owners, that is an invariant violation → **raise/log**.

## `main.py` behaviour notes

- Maintain a `dict[str, KeycloakAdmin]` cache keyed by realm name, protected by a `threading.Lock`.
- `get_admin(realm: str = Query(...))` is a FastAPI dependency. On each call it checks the cache; on a miss it acquires the lock, double-checks, and constructs a new `KeycloakAdmin(realm_name=realm, user_realm_name=KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM, ...)`. FastAPI returns `422` automatically if `realm` is absent.
- All endpoints except `/health` declare `admin: KeycloakAdmin = Depends(get_admin)`. `/health` calls `_get_or_create_admin` directly with `os.environ["KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_REALM"]` — no FastAPI dependency, no realm query param.
- Each GET endpoint calls the corresponding `python-keycloak` method and returns the result directly via `JSONResponse`.
- `GET /roles`: call `admin.get_realm_roles(brief_representation=False)`, then drop the role named `default-roles-{realm}` (the Keycloak-generated default composite for the realm) before enrichment.
- `GET /services/{service_id}/roles`: return the service's agent roles (`kind = Agent`) from **two** sources — `admin.get_client_roles(service_id)` (the client's client roles) **and** the `aiac.managed` realm roles assigned to its service account (`get_client_service_account_user` → `get_realm_roles_of_user`, each re-fetched via `get_realm_role_by_id` to test the `aiac.managed` marker; the client-role ids dedup against the realm-role set). Returns `[]` if `KeycloakError.response_code == 400` (service has no client roles); a missing service account simply contributes no realm roles; `502` on other `KeycloakError`. See the detailed contract above.
- `GET /services/{service_id}/scopes`: call `admin.get_client_default_client_scopes(service_id)`.
- `GET /roles/{role_name}/composites`: call `admin.get_composite_realm_roles_of_role(role_name=role_name)`.
- `POST /services/{service_id}/roles/{role_id}`: call `admin.get_client_service_account_user(service_id)` → extract `user["id"]` → call `admin.assign_realm_roles(user_id, [{"id": role_id}])`.
- On `KeycloakError`, return HTTP 502 with `{"error": str(e)}`.
