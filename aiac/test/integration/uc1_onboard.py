"""Shared harness for the UC-1 onboarding integration-test ladder (rungs 1–3).

Spec: ``docs/specs/integration-test/uc1-onboarding-pipeline.md``; live loop shape (handoff 08):
``k8s/opa-kind-runbook.md``. The evaluator is now the **deployed AuthBridge OPA plugin**, not a
standalone OPA-CLI run over dumped ``.rego`` — there is no ``.rego`` dump and no ``opa`` binary here.

Every rung follows the same shape against **one** live rossoctl/Kind cluster with the AuthBridge OPA
pipeline wired into both legs:

    Keycloak cleanup + policy-store clear
      → onboard the rung's workloads in order (POST /apply/service/{id} on the in-cluster Controller,
        which upserts the AuthorizationPolicy CR on the live API)
      → enable the outbound token-exchange leg (Part B: route + optional client scope + agent restart)
      → poll bundle-service + OPA until this run's CR is reflected in real decisions
      → drive REAL HTTP requests through AuthBridge and assert the real plugin's allow/deny
      → Keycloak cleanup + CR delete

The only thing that differs between rungs is *which workloads are onboarded and in what order*, so
all the machinery lives here and each ``test_uc1_onboard_*.py`` supplies just its own oracle
(verdicts computed from ``scenario_uc1.py``) and live assertions.

This module owns:

* **Config** (env, spec § Configuration) — single stack, no variants.
* **Keycloak** — ``connect_admin`` / ``provision_realm_and_users`` (the fixture UC-1 does *not* do) /
  ``resolve_service_id`` (route-safe trigger id = internal client UUID) / ``cleanup_provisioned``.
* **Onboarding** — ``ensure_agent_policy`` (mount the PRB's ``policy.md``) + ``onboard``.
* **Outbound-leg prep (Part B)** — ``ensure_github_tool_route`` / ``grant_exchange_scope`` /
  ``restart_agent`` so ``token-exchange`` runs and OPA is actually consulted on the outbound leg.
* **Live decision oracle + probes** — ``expected_inbound`` / ``expected_outbound_bare`` (verdicts from
  ``scenario_uc1``, keyed on the **bare** runtime tool names AuthBridge sends) and ``inbound_decision``
  / ``outbound_decision`` (mint a user token, send a real request through AuthBridge, classify the
  real plugin's response).
* **``onboarded_stack``** — the whole per-rung fixture flow, parameterised by the ordered workload
  list; each rung wraps it in a one-line session fixture and yields a probe context.

It imports only stdlib + ``requests`` + ``launcher`` + the pure-data ``scenario_uc1`` (never
``aiac``), so it is importable before the env-before-import dance, exactly like ``scenario_uc1`` and
``launcher``. It defines **no** ``test_*`` functions, so pytest does not collect it.

    unset; provision users/roles + clear the store; onboard the given ``workloads`` **in order**
    through the real in-cluster UC-1 Controller (``POST /apply/service/{id}``, upserting the CR);
    enable the outbound leg (Part B: route + optional client scope + agent restart); then **poll real

    registered as before (spec § Per-rung flow). The workload order is the rung's identity — e.g.
    rung 2 passes ``[agent, tool]`` so tool onboarding retroactively completes the agent's outbound
    gate; rung 3 passes ``[tool, agent]`` and must converge to the same live decisions.

      ``POLICY_ABSTRACT``). Forwarded to ``ensure_agent_policy``; a prose change reloads the Controller
      via the existing content-diff rollout.
    * ``default_effect`` — the derived ``AgentPolicyModel.default_effect`` this run onboards under
      (default: ``DEFAULT_EFFECT_DENY``, the shipped deny-by-default). A non-default value is applied to
      the Controller **before** onboarding via ``_set_controller_default_effect`` and **reset to
      ``Deny`` on teardown** so a subsequent Policy-A run on the shared stack is unaffected. ``Deny`` is
      a no-op (the stack is never patched), keeping Policy-A runs from touching the Controller env.
    * ``ready_signals`` — the convergence probe set to poll before yielding (default: the Policy-A
      ``_default_ready_signals``). A policy whose truth differs from Policy A (e.g. denyworld, where
      ``devops-user`` inbound is *allow*, not *deny*) supplies its own deterministic signals so the run
      converges on the right decisions; the raw-diagnostics message is recomputed against them."""
