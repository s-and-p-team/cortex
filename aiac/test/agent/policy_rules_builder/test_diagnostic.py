"""Deterministic unit tests for the read-only Conflict-Check diagnostic engine (#157).

Every LLM turn -- proposer, auditor, and the terminal explain call -- flows through the SAME
``graph._structured_call`` seam the live path uses, so ONE ``side_effect`` list drives all three
in order (mirrors ``test_graph.py``). No live endpoint is touched and, unlike the live graph, the
diagnostic seeds ``policy_text`` from input, so ``get_policy_source`` is never patched here.

Coverage: single-entity end-to-end RECORDING (not raising) a genuine contradiction -> classified
Conflict with verbatim quotes (role + scope directions); retry-budget exhaustion -> unevaluated
(no raise); explain kind classification; substring-validation failure -> quotes_verified=False +
description fallback; and ``_verify_quote`` as a pure function.
