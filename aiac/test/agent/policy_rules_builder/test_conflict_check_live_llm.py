"""Live-LLM planted-fixture suite for the Policy Conflict Check diagnostic (feature #154, task #160).

Mirrors ``test/agent/policy_rules_builder/test_graph_live_llm.py``: it runs the **real** LLM
end-to-end through the read-only conflict-check survey (``check_policy_conflicts``) and asserts
**structural** properties of the emitted ``ConflictReport`` -- never exact quote strings or
explanation wording (model nondeterminism; convergence on subtle prose is known-fragile).

Only the IdP catalog is stubbed -- the ``focal_entities._config`` seam ``check_policy_conflicts``
reuses for BOTH the ``service_type`` lookup and ``resolve_focal_entities`` (a single patch point,
preserving the 502/404 boundary). ``graph._structured_call`` is deliberately left **live** so the
real proposer / auditor / explain prompts run: a prompt-engineering regression (a missed conflict,
a hallucinated deny, a non-verbatim quote) fails a fixture here where a mocked suite could not see
it. The candidate ``policy_text`` is supplied **directly** to ``check_policy_conflicts`` (the
diagnostic seeds it from input -- no policy-source stub needed).

Gating: the module is marked **both** ``integration`` and ``llm``. ``integration`` -> the routine
``-m "not integration"`` run deselects it (its collected count is unchanged). ``llm`` -> it can be
selected on its own (``-m llm``) without a cluster or Keycloak. The autouse
``require_env_or_skip("LLM_BASE_URL", "LLM_MODEL", "LLM_API_KEY")`` fixture makes every test **skip
cleanly** (never crash, never false-pass) when the endpoint is unset.

Planting choice (documented): all three fixtures are planted on the **scope-focal** branch of the
survey. The focus service is a **Tool** that owns exactly **one** scope (the focal scope); the
offending pair's role is a **user-held realm role** (a ``candidate_role``, resolved from a stubbed
subject). Focus ``type == Tool`` means the AGENT-only role-focal branch never runs, so the survey
evaluates exactly the one planted scope-focal entity -- minimal surface, least nondeterminism, and
the direct/coarse collision is adjudicated against a real, typed ``(candidate_role, own_scope)``
pair exactly as a scope-focal run does.
