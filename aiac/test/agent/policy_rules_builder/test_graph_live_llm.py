"""Live-LLM acceptance tests for aiac.agent.policy_rules_builder.graph.

Unlike test_graph.py (which mocks the LLM at the graph._structured_call seam), this
suite runs the **real** LLM end-to-end through the Policy Rules Builder and asserts that
the emitted ``list[PolicyRule]`` matches the policy text. Only the *inputs* are mocked —
role/scope **descriptions** are set inline and the **policy source** is stubbed at
graph.get_policy_source — so the suite needs **no Kubernetes and no Keycloak**, only an
LLM endpoint. The ``_structured_call`` seam is deliberately **left live**: the whole
point is to exercise the real proposer/auditor prompts, so a prompt-engineering
regression (an over-grant, a missed deny, a hallucinated deny, a wrong effect) fails a
fixture here where the mocked suite cannot see it.

Gating: the module is marked **both** ``integration`` and ``llm``. It is ``integration``
because it calls a real LLM endpoint — that is exactly what the ``integration`` marker
means — so the routine unit run (``-m "not integration"``) deselects it and its collected
count is unchanged by this suite. It is additionally ``llm`` so it can be selected on its
own (``-m llm``) without a cluster or Keycloak, unlike the cluster-bound integration
suite. Every test also first calls
``require_env_or_skip("LLM_BASE_URL", "LLM_MODEL", "LLM_API_KEY")`` so it **skips cleanly**
(never crashes, never false-passes) when the endpoint is not configured. Run it opt-in
with ``-m llm`` (env sourced).

Each fixture asserts **exact set equality** of the emitted ``{(counterpart.name, effect)}``
pairs against a hand-verified expected set — a subset check would let over-/under-grants
pass. Expected sets are derived by hand from the SCENARIO-layer deny triggers documented
in ``docs/handoffs/03/04-*.md`` and ``prompts.py`` (_DENY_RULES): explicit prohibition
("must not" / "read-only") -> DENY; a prohibition stated only in a description -> DENY;
"only …" -> derived DENY complement over the rest of the candidate set.
