"""Unit tests for the cross-service applied-rule gatherer (#2504).

``applied_rules_for_scopes`` supplies the OTHER half of cross-service conflict detection: the
already-applied inbound rules (allow AND deny) of the services that OWN the scopes a build touches,
read from the Policy Store. The builder unions them with its own rules and runs the #2502 core over
the combined state, so this gatherer must (a) read exactly the owning SPMs, once each, (b) return
BOTH inbound lists, (c) never mutate the store, and (d) tolerate a brand-new owner (empty SPM).
These are deterministic (NOT ``integration``/``llm``): the store read is patched, no HTTP happens.

It lives in the onboarding use-case layer (next to ``builder.py``), NOT the PRB package, so the
PRB stays store-free (``test_isolation``) — this test mirrors that source location.
