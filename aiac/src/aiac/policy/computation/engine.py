"""Policy Computation Engine (SPM-based, order-independent).

A pure library that folds partial ``list[PolicyRule]`` updates into the persistent,
per-service source of truth — ``ServicePolicyModel`` (SPM) — and then **derives** each
affected agent's ``AgentPolicyModel`` (APM) entirely from those SPMs before partial-upserting
them to the PDP Policy Writer.

Why SPMs. The previous design persisted only per-agent APMs with rules denormalised onto the
agent, which made the merge outcome depend on onboarding order (``UR→TS`` was dropped when the
tool onboarded before any agent targeted it). Here every rule ``(role → scope)`` is stored as an
inbound edge on ``SPM(scope.serviceId)`` — the service that *owns* the scope — so the fact
survives regardless of which services already exist, and both onboarding orders converge to the
same derived ``APM(A)``.

Input contract. Each ``PolicyRule`` arrives with ``scope.serviceId``, ``role.kind`` and
``role.actorIds`` already populated and with roles already flattened to their closure. The PCE
performs no IdP lookup for routing/classification and no role flattening — the only runtime IdP
read is ``Configuration.get_services()`` for the identity (P2) seed.

Drift GC. Because Keycloak UUIDs churn on delete/recreate, an append-only merge would let stale
edges pile up beside their superseded generations. So after routing, ``_reconcile`` prunes each
*touched* SPM against that same ``get_services()`` catalog (no extra IdP read) — dropping edges
whose scope or agent-role no longer exists and collapsing churned/duplicate user-role generations.
It removes only edges whose entity is gone, so order-independence is preserved.

Offboard / decommission. Reconcile is passive and catalog-anchored: it never wipes an SPM whose
owning service is absent from ``get_services()`` (a transient miss must not destroy state). That
leaves the *decommission* drift species uncovered — once a service's Keycloak client is deleted it
falls out of the catalog forever, so its own ``SPM(X)`` and its outbound footprint (``X_role →
other_scope`` edges on *other* SPMs) would linger, and its ``APM(X)`` would stay in the PDP.
``decommission(service_id)`` is the authoritative counterpart: it acts on an explicit offboard
signal (not the catalog-miss guard), tears down X's entire footprint, and re-derives every agent
whose policy changed. It is keyed by the **clientId (SPM key)**, not the Keycloak UUID — after the
client is deleted, ``get_services()`` can no longer resolve UUID→clientId.

Fire-and-forget — ``compute_and_apply`` and ``decommission`` re-raise dependency failures.
