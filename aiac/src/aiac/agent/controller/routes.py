"""AIAC Agent Controller — FastAPI app factory + the four ``/apply/*`` routes.

The Controller is stateless. Each route dispatches to its use-case handler
(orchestrator or sub-agent), receives the ``(list[PolicyRule], override)`` tuple
the handler returns, and makes the **single** ``compute_and_apply(rules, override)``
call to the Policy Computation Engine. No per-use-case business logic, retry
handling, or state assembly lives here.

Responses are bare HTTP status codes: ``200 OK`` on success (no body). Upstream
failures are raised as FastAPI ``HTTPException``s by the handlers; the status
code is authoritative (the accompanying default JSON error body is incidental).

# NEVER ``str(exc)``: an endpoint / host / API key embedded in a transport error (or a poisoned

# the specific handlers keeps the intent explicit; resolution itself is by specificity, not order —
# Starlette walks the exception's MRO and picks the most-specific REGISTERED handler, so a mapped
