"""Service Onboarding Orchestrator (UC1).

The only use case with an Orchestrator, because it is a **two-stage** pipeline. Invoked by
the Controller for the ``aiac.apply.service.{id}`` / ``POST /apply/service/{service_id}``
trigger, it sequences the two sub-agents and returns ``(list[PolicyRule], override=False)``:

    1. Service Provision  — classifies the service and writes its roles/scopes into the IdP,
       producing the discovered ``service_type`` and the **created-manifest** (exactly the
       roles/scopes it created on this run — see ``provision_service``).
    2. Service Policy Builder — reads the excluded-self IdP universe and builds the rules.

There is **no Apply stage** here: the Controller makes the single
``compute_and_apply(rules, override=False)`` (PCE) call. UC1 is incremental, so ``override``
is always ``False`` (append; existing roles keep their other access).

**Replay safety (at-least-once delivery):** Provision IdP writes are idempotent and the PCE
reconcile is idempotent, so a crash between stages simply re-runs the full pipeline to
convergence on NATS redelivery. A build **failure**, however, triggers a **compensating
rollback** (UC1-only) before the error propagates — see :func:`_rollback`.

# created-manifest — and a rollback would then delete an entity the other run still uses.
# A per-service lock serializes the whole lifecycle so same-service runs proceed one at a
# time, while DIFFERENT service_ids stay concurrent (each has its own lock). Guarding only
# ``provision_service`` is insufficient because the rollback runs here in the orchestrator.
#
# Multi-replica caveat: this in-process lock serializes within ONE agent replica only.
# Cross-replica serialization (multiple agent pods sharing a Keycloak realm) needs external
# coordination (e.g. a distributed lock) and is out of scope here.
