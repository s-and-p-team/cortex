"""Policy Conflict Check survey orchestrator (feature #154, task #158).

Re-homed (#2500) from the retired ``uc/policy_check`` use-case into the diagnostic library, next
to the per-entity engine it drives (``diagnostic.py``). It is now a plain internal library
function with no dependency on any route — the standalone ``/policy/check`` route was retired so
``/apply`` is the sole policy entry point; a later ticket folds this orchestrator into ``/apply``.

A **sequential, read-only** survey that runs EVERY focal entity of a target service through the
Conflict-Check diagnostic graph (#157) to completion, accumulates every run's ``conflicts`` +
``unevaluated``, and returns a single :class:`ConflictReport`. Unlike the live ``/apply`` path,
the first genuine conflict does NOT abort the survey — all entities are always run, so the report
lists ALL of that service's conflicts at once.

This is the diagnostic counterpart of ``ServicePolicyBuilder.build()`` (the live fan-out loop in
``uc/onboarding/policy_builder/builder.py``): it resolves the SAME typed entity set via the shared
``resolve_focal_entities`` (#155) and mirrors that loop's fan-out EXACTLY (scope-focal over every
own scope; role-focal over every flattened own role, AGENT services only). It differs in three
deliberate ways:

  * it is READ-ONLY — it never runs Provision (which MUTATES the IdP) and never calls the PCE /
    orchestrator. The target service is a PRE-EXISTING catalog entry, so its ``service_type`` is
    read straight from the catalog (``focus.type``) rather than being (re)discovered by Provision.
  * it drives ``run_scope_diagnostic`` / ``run_role_diagnostic`` (the record-not-raise diagnostic
    graph), not ``build_scope_rules`` / ``build_role_rules`` (the live raise-on-conflict builder).
  * a found conflict is a SUCCESSFUL diagnosis, not an error — it is recorded, never raised. Only
    the pre-survey resolver boundary (``HTTPException(502)`` IdP-unreachable /
    ``HTTPException(404)`` unknown-service) propagates.

``service_type`` note (the one real design decision — done READ-ONLY): the resolver needs a
``service_type``, but we must NOT run Provision to (re)discover it. For a pre-existing catalog
entry ``focus.type`` IS the authoritative classification, so we resolve the focus service by
``id`` from the same ``get_services()`` catalog the resolver reads and take ``focus.type``. The
builder's "never conflate service_type with focus.type" caution applies ONLY to the live
onboarding path (where a NEW service's type is being discovered), not to this read-only diagnostic
over an existing service. The same ``Configuration`` seam (``focal_entities._config`` /
``Configuration.for_default_realm``) is reused for BOTH the type lookup and the resolver, so the
``HTTPException(502/404)`` pre-survey boundary is preserved and tests patch a single seam.
