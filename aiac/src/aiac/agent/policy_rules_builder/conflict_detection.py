"""Inline structural conflict detection for the assembled service policy (#2502).

After a ``build()`` assembles every pass's output (scope-focal grants + the Door B
user-role-focal deny pass) into one ``list[PolicyRule]``, :func:`detect_conflicts` runs a
**pure, deterministic** allow∩deny set-intersection over ``(role.id, scope.id)``: a pair carrying
**both** an ``Allow`` and a ``Deny`` **is** a conflict. There is no LLM anywhere in this module.

Per ADR 0001 (*identify-never-reconcile*) the detector NEVER merges, drops, or picks a winner —
it surfaces the overlap as a :class:`ConflictReport` so the build can **raise before**
``compute_and_apply`` (atomic-by-construction: a conflict leaves persisted state untouched). This
is the *cross-pass* structural **conflict**, distinct from the LLM auditor's *intra-pass*
``PolicyContradictionError`` (``graph.py``); the two are disjoint by construction.

At this ticket the report is the **structural** form: real ids, ``kind=DIRECT``, a synthesized
``explanation``, no quotes (``quotes_verified=False``). ``Conflict.focal`` anchors on the SCOPE
side (settled design Q16). Verbatim-quote enrichment and the 422-body wiring land in #2503.
