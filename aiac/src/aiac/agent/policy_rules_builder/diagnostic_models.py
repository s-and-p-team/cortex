"""Structured models for the read-only policy **conflict-check** diagnostic (feature #154).

This module defines ONLY the stable serialization shape shared by the diagnostic engine and the
survey orchestrator — no pipeline logic. The live ``/apply``
path and its models (``PolicyRule``, ``Contradiction``, ``AuditVerdict`` in ``graph.py`` /
``policy.model.models``) are deliberately untouched (decision D11): the typed conflict ``kind``
lives here, produced by the diagnostic's ``explain`` node, rather than being bolted onto the
shared ``Contradiction`` / ``AuditVerdict`` that the byte-for-byte-stable live path depends on.

Style mirrors the rest of the agent/policy layer: ``str``-subclass ``Enum``s (so
``FocalType.ROLE == "role"`` holds and they serialize as their string value) and pydantic
``BaseModel`` with ``ConfigDict(extra="ignore")``.
