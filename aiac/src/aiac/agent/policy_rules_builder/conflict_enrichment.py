"""LLM enrichment of a structural ``ConflictReport`` (#2503).

``detect_conflicts`` (#2502, :mod:`conflict_detection`) finds allow∩deny ``(role, scope)`` overlaps
**deterministically** and returns a *structural* :class:`ConflictReport`: real ids,
``kind=DIRECT``, a synthesized ``explanation``, and no quotes (``quotes_verified=False``). This
module upgrades EXACTLY those already-found pairs — never a blind full re-survey — by running the
diagnostic ``explain``/quote pass over each one to (1) classify the ``kind`` (``direct`` vs
``coarse_scope``) and (2) extract verbatim, substring-validated ``granting_quotes`` /
``prohibiting_quotes`` from the candidate policy text.

It is invoked by ``ServicePolicyBuilder.build()`` **only when** ``detect_conflicts`` returns
conflicts, so a clean apply makes ZERO explain-LLM calls (the explain seam is
:func:`_explain_pair`). The pairs are fixed (the structural detector's output); each is explained
once against the candidate ``policy_text``. On ANY quote-validation failure the conflict is KEPT
with ``quotes_verified=False`` and the explanation falls back to the structural synthesized
description (ADR 0001: surface, never drop — reversing handoff-07 Q15/Q16, which had decided the
on-``/apply`` report would be quote-less / no-LLM).
